# Spectrode in R
An R implementation of the Spectrode method for computing the limit eigenvalue distribution of 
high-dimensional sample covariance matrices. 

Please see the `Examples` folder for examples, and the `Code` folder for the main code. 

# Additional notes
* The method was proposed in the following paper 
Dobriban. E, *Efficient Computation of Limit Spectra of Sample Covariance Matrices*, 
Random Matrices: Theory Appl., 04, 1550019 (2015). http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.01649

* This package is work in progress. Suggestions and comments are welcome. 
A MATLAB version is also available https://github.com/dobriban/EigenEdge/.
The latter is much more developed, and has a detailed documentation with examples.
In time, this R package should have more functionality added. 


We thank Haeran Cho for pointing out a typo in the code.
